			<h1>What is Darhk?</h1>
			<p>Many of us own and use multiple electronic devices at our home and the world around us. Have we ever thought to consider how much energy we are consuming? Project Darhk is a new search engine by Google, designed to collectively reduce energy consumption.</p>

			<h1>The Technology</h1>
			<img src="assets/hoaxwebsite3.jpg">
			<p>Darhk works by reducing the amount of lit pixels on your screen by turning the background of a web page from a white to a dark background. By doing this your device draws less power, saving more energy and extending the life of your hardware and others around you.</p>

			<h1>Powerful Search</h1>
			<p>Darhk is a search engine supported by the world's largest index of web pages, Google Search. <span style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 800;">60 TRILLION INDIVIDUAL PAGES</span> and it's constantly growing. We sort pages by their content and other factors. Behind your simple page of results is a complex system, carefully crafted and tested, to support more than one-hundred billion searches each month.</p>

			<h1>Where Darhk Has Been</h1>
			<p>Project Darhk began in November 2015 with an experimental pilot in Portland, Oregon, where a small group of local business owners tested the service. The results of the pilot test, as well as subsequent tests in Portland, the Bay Area, and New York, are being used to improve the technology.
