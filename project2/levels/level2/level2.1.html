<h1>Suburban</h1>
<p>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspConformity caught here, nobody catches it,
<br>
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLawns groomed in prose, with hardly a stutter.
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>Lloyd</strong> hits the ball, and <strong>Lorraine</strong> fetches it.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMom hangs the laundry, Fred, Jr., watches it,
<br>
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspShirts in the cliched air, all aflutter.
<br>
<br>
<br><em>Conformity</em> caught here, nobody catches it.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA dog drops a bone, another dog snatches it.
<br>
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI dreamed of this life once, Now I shudder
<br>
<br>
<br>As <strong>Lloyd</strong> hits the ball and <strong>Lorraine</strong> fetches it.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA doldrum of leaky roofs, a roofer who patches it,
<br>
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLloyd prowls the streets, still clutching his putter.
<br>
<br>
<br><em>Conformity</em> caught here, nobody catches it.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe tediumed rake, the retiree who matches it,
<br> 
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe fall air gone dead with the pure drone of motors
<br>
<br>
<br>While <strong>Lloyd</strong> hits the ball, and <strong>Lorraine</strong> just fetches it.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe door is ajar, then somebody latches it.
<br>
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThrough the hissing of barbecues poets mutter
<br>
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOf conformity caught here, where nobody catches it.
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>Lloyd</strong> hits the ball. And damned <strong>Lorraine</strong> fetches it.
