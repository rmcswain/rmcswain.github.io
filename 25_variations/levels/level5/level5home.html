		<br>Conformity caught here, nobody catches it,
		<br>Lawns groomed in prose, with hardly a stutter.
		<br>Lloyd hits the ball, and Lorraine fetches it.
		<br>
		<br>Mom hangs the laundry, Fred, Jr., watches it,
		<br>Shirts in the cliched air, all aflutter.
		<br>Conformity caught here, nobody catches it.
		<br>
		<br>A dog drops a bone, another dog snatches it.
		<br>I dreamed of this life once, Now I shudder
		<br>As Lloyd hits the ball and Lorraine fetches it.
		<br>
		<br>A doldrum of leaky roofs, a roofer who patches it,
		<br>Lloyd prowls the streets, still clutching his putter.
		<br>Conformity caught here, nobody catches it.
		<br>
		<br>The tediumed rake, the retiree who matches it, 
		<br>The fall air gone dead with the pure drone of motors
		<br>While Lloyd hits the ball, and Lorraine just fetches it.
		<br>
		<br>The door is ajar, then somebody latches it.
		<br>Through the hissing of barbecues poets mutter 
		<br>Of conformity caught here, where nobody catches it.
		<br>Lloyd hits the ball. And damned Lorraine fetches it.
